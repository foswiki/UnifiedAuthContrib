%TOC%

This extension provides:

   * A user mapping, assigning readable names to each user.
      * For each of the existing authentication providers (listed below), a mapping is provided.
   * A login manager that supports authentication from multiple sources (auth providers). The following sources are currently supported:
      * Foswiki's !BaseUserMapping (specifically, !AdminUser)
      * Google accounts
   * A mapping for groups and group memberships that supports multiple data source. The following sources are currently supported:
      * Foswiki's System.TopicUserMappingContrib (copied implementation; this will be improved later)
   * A small plugin to handle user interface for selecting an auth provider (not implemented yet). The plugin must be enabled in order for logins to work.

Internally, the mapping data is stored in a database. Unless you provide your own configuration, this is an SQLite database file.

---++ Settings
The main settings are made via the =/bin/configure= interface or =LocalSite.cfg=. They are documented in the configuration interface. The details of how to configure each authentication provider live here, so as to not overload the configuration interface with text.

---+++ Auth provider configuration

Auth providers are configured in ={UnifiedAuth}{Providers}=. You can set up the same auth provider multiple times with different settings, giving each instance a different ID. The =config= hash is different for each provider; for providers shipped with !UnifiedAuthContrib, documentation follows.

---++++ Google

   * =client_id=: The ID for your Google API access, registered in Google's developer console.
   * =client_secret=: The secret token for your Google API access.
   * =domain=: optional; if set, only Google accounts on this domain can be used.
   * =wikiname_format=: how to generate wiki names from the account data. This can use field names as provided by Google (e.g. =name=, =email=, =given_name=, =family_name=). Field names must be prefixed by a =$= sign to be expanded. Any characters not permitted in wiki names will be eliminated after expansion. (Defaults to =$name=)
   * =displayname_format=: same, but for the readable display name. (Defaults to =$name=)

---++++ IpRange

Allows automatically logging in a user based on their IP address. This makes it possible to grant restricted, guest-like access based on a user's location.

   * =ip_range=: an arrayref or a single value. Each value is either an IP address range (e.g. '192.168.1.0-192.168.1.255') or a netblock in CIDR notation. (Individual IP addresses must be specified as e.g. 1.2.3.4/32 or ::/128.) Both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported.
   * =exclude_ip_range=: if set, similar to =ip_range= but prevents these addresses from getting authenticated even if they match one of the IP ranges given in =ip_range=.
   * =user_id=: The user ID (of an existing !UnifiedAuth user) which this auth provider authenticates. Anyone logging in from one of the addresses in =ip_range= is automatically assigned this user ID.

If you want to automatically create the user in question, include the following fields, too. Since the user will only be created once, these fields have no effect afterwards.

   * =wiki_name=: The WikiName assigned to the user.
   * =display_name=: The display name.
   * =email=: Optionally, assign an e-mail address.
